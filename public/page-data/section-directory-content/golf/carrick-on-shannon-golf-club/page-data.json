The course has  been constructed bearing in mind the specifications prescribed by USGA and is  the perfect place for having a good time with friends and family. Its situation  by the river Shannon makes for veritable variety of pleasant views, which is  worth preserving through a camera lens. Moreover, this parkland course is  surrounded by Argina Mountains and is awesomely impressive.</p>\n<p>The  recently constructed nine holes of this amazing 18 holes course stretches up to  Drumharlow Lake and the Boyle River. This has resulted in creation of some  delightfully pretty sights of both the river and the lake, along with the 12  acres of marshland. In a way, it is good that this marshland has been turned as  a part of the course as it poses problems for golf players who find the nearby  holes difficult to play over. Although the course offers several brilliant  holes, the one that must be mentioned is the 13th hole which is  feared because of its par 3 score. It is advisable that a golf lover discovers  the charm of the place with his own eyes to believe it.          </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Carrick on Shannon Golf Club","county":"Leitrim","category":"Golf","images":["carrick-on-shannon-golf-club-4.jpg","500","329","carrick-on-shannon-golf-club-5.jpg","500","329","carrick-on-shannon-golf-club-6.jpg","200","160"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"group":[{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Drumcoura City Lake Resort","county":"Leitrim","category":"Equestrian Schools","excerpt":"Drumcoura City Lake Resort is holiday resort located near the town of Ballinamore, Co.
