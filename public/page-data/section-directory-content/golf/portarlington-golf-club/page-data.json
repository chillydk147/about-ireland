The restaurant  is known for its fabulous service which even keeps into consideration the  different tastes of visitors. </p>\n<p>This  18 holes course presents many tough and exciting holes to passionate golfers  who can test their skills. The club started off as a nine holes course in 1908  and was upgraded to 18 holes only in 1987. At present, its course spreads over  an area of almost six thousand meters in length, which preserves as well as  promotes wildlife of the area. The architect, Eddie Hackett, has tapped in the  full potential of the available terrain to provide a course which is wondrously  great to play at.
