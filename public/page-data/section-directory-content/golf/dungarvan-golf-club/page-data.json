The opportunity to witness the wonders of nature arise  because of the fact that the club has Comeragh Mountains as its backdrop. The  architectural soundness of this 18 hole course excites all golfers and compels  them to prove their mettle. The area on which men are allowed to play measures  6,688 yards, while the women can play on an area of 5,456 yards. The club also  has a special policy towards visitors with the view to provide them an  excellent time at the course. </p>\n<p>Established  in the year 1920, the staff at the club is always willing to serve guests and  members and provide the hospitable service in the bar, clubhouse and  restaurant. In addition to these, other facilities are also available such as  renting carts, trolleys and clubs. Moreover, there is a practice area as well  as a pro shop within the premises of the club.
