The 18 holes golf  course of this club is built as parkland and comprises several mature trees.  The picture-perfect beauty of the serene environs makes the golfing experience  at this club all the more pleasurable. While golfing, the magnificently  impressive sights of Longford town are very hard to ignore.   </p>\n<p>One  has to stay alert while playing a round of the game in this golf course that  has a par score of 72 and spreads over 6700 yards. This is because a stream  comes into play at many holes, not sparing even the last one. In addition to  this, other water hazards have also been added to spice up the game and make it  more challenging; especially the signature 13th hole. </p>\n<p>Apart  from the golfing course, there are other means of relaxation provided by the  club through its club house, bar and Pro Shop. Other facilities that help one  play a better game when availed include trolley and buggy hire. As one of the  premium 18 holes golf courses in the Republic of Ireland, it truly deserves a  visit by all travelers and visitors to County Longford </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Longford Golf Club","county":"Roscommon","category":"Golf","images":["longford-golf-club-0.jpg","300","200","longford-golf-club-2.jpg","500","375","longford-golf-club-3.jpg","500","328","longford-golf-club-4.jpg","400","268"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"group":[{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Donamon Castle","county":"Roscommon","category":"Castles","excerpt":"One of  the oldest inhabited buildings in Ireland, Donamon Castle is an architectural  marvel located in County Roscommon in the Republic of Ireland...."},"fields":{"slug":"/section-directory-content/castles/donamon-castle/"},"id":"2ce81373-fdfa-5d55-94b9-8d73dc7d310f"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Roscommon Castle","county":"Roscommon","category":"Castles","excerpt":"Situated in the Irish Midlands, County  Roscommon is a peaceful area with some of the glorious cultural attractions and  well preserved rich historica..."},"fields":{"slug":"/section-directory-content/castles/roscommon-castle/"},"id":"9bdcb9ba-2871-5e07-8523-8985f0e11a84"}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/section-directory-content/golf/longford-golf-club/","county":"Roscommon","id":"9ea97456-c53c-5406-8fac-4142d347689f"}}}
