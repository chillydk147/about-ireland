It is admired by local as well as  international golf lovers for its 18 holes parkland style course that has been  designed by Peter McEvoy. It brings to the fore not only the architectural  genius of the great architect but also the natural beauty the course is endowed  with. Additionally, the detailing and layout of the course, along with some  magnificent views of Irish Sea, make it a perfect place to play the wonderful  game of golf. A large scale drainage program was recently undertaken by the  club to enable golfers to enjoy their favorite game throughout the year. </p>\n<p>Located  in the heart of Ireland, the club was started only in 2002 and has borne  witness to visits by celebrated golfers like 2007 Irish Open winner Padraig  Harrington. Other famous personalities that have enjoyed a game at the course  are Trevor Immelman, British Open Winner Paul Lawrie and golf veteran Barry  Lane. Perhaps what attracted them to the place are the extraordinary holes of  the course which are excellent from tee to green. The accompanying water  features and sand based greens having some challenging par threes excite casual  as well as professional golfers. If one is passionate about golf, then a visit  to this Irish golf course should not be missed.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Seafield Golf and Country Club","county":"Wexford","category":"Golf","images":["seafield-golf-and-country-club-1.jpg","500","287","seafield-golf-and-country-club-2.jpg","200","160","seafield-golf-and-country-club-3.jpg","450","120"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"group":[{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Newtownbarry House Gardens and Gallery","county":"Wexford","category":"Art Galleries","excerpt":"Newtownbarry House was built in the year 1883 by Charles Lanyon and this magnificent mansion was his last creation.
