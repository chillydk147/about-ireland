Making people take notice of  the great wonders of nature, this vibrant wonderland of stalactites and stalagmites  measures 3.8 kilometers in length and has two levels. Starting at Glounsharoon,  Crag Cave trails under Castleisland and finally ends on its distant side at the  Killarney Road. The cave system provides picturesque sights of Tralee Bay and  the McGillicuddy. </p>\n<p>Although  its potential had been hinted at by the Geological Survey of Ireland 1859, it  was in 1981 that due attention began to be given to its exploration. The sump  of this cave system formed in the elevated limestone rock was finally  discovered in 1983. Dr. Donal and Mrs. Margaret Geaney, under whose land the  cave was first discovered, contributed in its preliminary development. The  shaft that was added between 1987 and 1989 serves as the only man-made entrance  to this spectacular cave. Pathways, railings, lights and a music system were  also added to turn it into a show cave.</p>\n<p>A  guided tour of the many chambers of Crag Cave, which includes a Cathedral named  Crystal Gallery, takes just half an hour and is enjoyed by visitors of all age  groups. The impressive facilities provided at the place, especially the play  area called Crazy Cave, pulls in thousands of tourists annually.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Facilities: Tourist center, Gift shop,  Coffee shop, Car parking, coach parking, garden restaurant and children’s play  area </li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Opening Times: Open daily from 10am to 6pm  (January and February closed Mondays and Tuesdays)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n  <li>Admission Charges for Cave: Adult- €12.00,  Child- €5.00, Student/Senior- €9.00, Family (2 + 2) - €30.00, Family (2 + 4) -  €35.00</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Admission charges for Crazy Cave Adventure  Center: Child- €8.00 for 2 hours play, Cave and Play area both- €11.00</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Crag Cave","county":"Kerry","category":"Caves","images":["crag-cave-0.jpg","300","200","crag-cave-3.jpg","500","474","crag-cave-6.jpg","479","252","crag-cave-8.jpg","200","200","crag-cave-9.jpg","233","150"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"group":[{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Mcbride Gallery","county":"Kerry","category":"Art Galleries","excerpt":"Mcbride Gallery has an exotic collection of the artistic excellence of contemporary Irish artworks.
