This famous show cave attracts tourist and visitors from all around the  world who enjoy this half a mile long visual treat. The brilliance of the three  huge caverns displayed by the natural drip stone formations, calcite columns,  stalagmites and stalactites overwhelms the onlooker with a mix of excitement  and awe.</p>\n<p>As  one of the best limestone caves in Europe, a visitor will regret if he or she  misses out the opportunity to see the impressive views at <em>Mitchelstown</em> Cave.  This 16 km long and 5 km wide cave was discovered accidentally by a local,  Michael Condon, while searching for his lost crowbar. The entrance found by him  is used even till today to access this wondrous cave. The depth of the cave  might be a mere 1 km but the amazing stalactite and stalagmite formations make  this place worth a visit. The 10 meters tall Tower of Babel must be seen if one  wants to truly witness the special aesthetic gifts of creation bestowed by  nature on mankind. Not only adults, but also children enjoy visiting this  spectacular show cave.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Opening Hours: Open throughout the year</li>\n  <li>April to September: 10am – 5:30pm</li>\n  <li>October to March: 10am - closing time will  vary </li>\n  <li>Admission: Minimum of two adults required  for guided tour</li>\n  <li>Adult: €7</li>\n  <li>Child: €2 (up to 12 years old)</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Mitchelstown Cave","county":"Tipperary","category":"Caves","images":["mitchelstown-cave-0.jpg","300","425","mitchelstown-cave-1.jpg","453","142","mitchelstown-cave-2.jpg","390","260","mitchelstown-cave-3.jpg","300","225","mitchelstown-cave-4.jpg","150","150"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"group":[{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Crossogue Equestrian Centre","county":"Tipperary","category":"Equestrian Schools","excerpt":"Crossogue Equestrian Centre is taken care of Molloy family, which has been involved with the horses for five generations.
