It is one of the best show caves out of the  many in Ireland and is located within the proximity of Enniskillen. To be more  specific, it is situated in the rolling lowlands and the uneven mountainous  uplands of counties Cavan and Fermanagh. Part of the National Nature Reserve,  it offers spectacular views of perhaps the best Irish landscapes. </p>\n<p>The  Geopark simultaneously provides an insight into the 650 million years long  history of this area. The wide area that the Geopark sprawls over includes many  sites that arouse the interest of people, especially those who love history,  archeology, folklore, wildlife and geology. Moreover, the area is also found  suitable for adventurous activities like cycling and trekking. </p>\n<p>It  takes around 75 minutes to take a tour of Marble Arch Caves, which begins with  an underground boat trip followed by seeing formations like Porridge Pot, Moses  Walk and Guardian Angel. Stalactites and stalagmites can be observed throughout  the tour, conducted under the expert eye of a guide.</p>\n<p>If  one is planning a visit to the place, it must be remembered that the caves  might close in case of adverse weather conditions. It is therefore advisable to  find out before going to the caves and also make prior bookings on  holidays.    </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Facilities: Car parking, souvenir shop,  restaurant, exhibition area and audio visual theatre </li>\n  <li>Opening times: End of March - End of June:  10am - 4.30pm, July - August: 10am - 5pm, September: 10am - 4.30pm (The latter  in all cases are the starting times for last tours.)</li>\n  <li>Admission Charges:</li>\n  <li>Adult- £8</li>\n  <li>Children (under 18) - £5</li>\n  <li>Children Under 5- free but must be  allocated a ticket at the reception</li>\n  <li>Family (2 adults and three children) - £18</li>\n  <li>Students and Senior Citizens- £5.25</li>\n  <li>Groups (10 or more): Adults- £7.50 per  person, Children- £4.50 per child, Students and Senior Citizens- £4.75 per  person</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark","county":"Fermanagh","category":"Caves","images":["marble-arch-caves-global-geopark-1.jpg","500","333","marble-arch-caves-global-geopark-3.jpg","283","204"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"group":[{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Frances Morris Studio and Gallery","county":"Fermanagh","category":"Art Galleries","excerpt":"Frances Morris Studio and Gallery displays widely acclaimed work of Irish landscapes by Frances Morris, one of the renowned Irish artists.
