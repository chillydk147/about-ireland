Located in County Clare, this cave houses the longest stalactite in  the northern hemisphere. Discovered in 1952, the length of this admirably great  stalactite has been calculated to be 6.54 meter or 20 feet.</p>\n<p>The  mystery and the suspense of discovering something unthought-of always hovers  over visitors making their way into a cave. When confronted with this massive  stalactite that hangs down from the roof of this limestone cave, the expression  usually observed on every face is that of sheer awe. The exhilaration  experienced after watching one of the most impressive geological phenomena with  one’s own eyes is something one cherishes for the rest of the life. </p>\n<p>Only  a limited number of visitors, say 20, are permitted to enter the premises at  any given point of time to preserve the pristine environment of Doolin Cave.  One should mind the 120 steps and not hurry up while climbing down the stairs  leading to the cave. It is advisable to wear outdoor clothing and shoes while  enjoying the pleasure experienced while exploring this beautiful cave. To make  the experience truly unforgettable, one should explore the primeval world of  Doolin Cave with friends and family.            </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Facilities: Visitor Center</li>\n  <li>Open Times: April to November daily 9am-5  pm</li>\n  <li>Admission Charges: Adults- EUR 15,  Children- EUR 8, Family- EUR 50, 10% on-line booking discount</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Doolin Cave","county":"Clare","category":"Caves","images":["the-doolin-cave-0.jpg","346","230","the-doolin-cave-1.jpg","300","448","the-doolin-cave-3.jpg","379","500","the-doolin-cave-4.jpg","500","462"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"group":[{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Aillwee Cave","county":"Clare","category":"Caves","excerpt":"Among  the numerous ancient Irish caves beneath karst-landscape of Burren, Aillwee  Cave is the most popular.
