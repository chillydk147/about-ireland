Galway, the county borough of Ireland, is the gateway to the west coast land of Ireland. This medieval site was added to county's walls to protect the merchant ships and town's quays from being plundered. A Town quay, which was originally known as the fish market, is now known as the Spanish Parade. It is situated at the meeting point of Galway bay and River Corrib, directly across The Claddagh. Therefore, Spanish Arch is included on the Barnaby Gooche (Provost Marshal of Connaught) Map of Galway, dated 1583. </p>  \n    <p>The name Spanish Arch has been anglicised from an Irish word An P&oacute;irse Sp&aacute;inneach. This citadel was constructed in 1854 during the reign of Wylliam Martin and was known as The Blind Arch or the Ceann an Bhalla, meaning the head of the wall. The Arch was financed by the granting of Royal Murage Charters, which allowed the authorities to collect taxes on goods being sold in the town. A percentage of these taxes went towards the construction and maintenance of the walls.</p>  \n    <p>In the late 12th century, the Normans began to surround the prospering town of Galway with a large and strongly constructed stone wall. The main purpose behind the erection of the wall was the protection against the Irish. This further led to the fortification of medieval docks, located in front of the Arch area. This plundering came to an end in 1583, with the erection of a citadel, which today is known as The Spanish Arch. It is also considered that the Spanish Arch is a misnomer, as association between the Spanish in Galway and the building of the Arch has not been proven. </p>  \n    <p>The Arch was constructed in such a manner that troops could be housed inside, with its entrance on the dockside of the structure. The outer walls of this structure were repeatedly touched by the rushing sea. Numerous cannons were positioned on the top of the structure affirming complete protection. Eyre family of Eyrecourt, County Galway, in the 18th century, created an extension of the quays, which came to be known as The Long Walk. With this, arches were structured that allowed access into the new quays from the town.</p>  \n    <p>During the historic times, this area of the town was a place with enthralling scenic beauty. Numerous ships, which were charged with imported wines, spices and other precious commodities landed here. These laden ships, which were on their way to the merchants princes off the town, sailed out into Galway Bay carrying their produce across many European ports.</p>  \n    <p>This remainder of the 16th century bastion highlights a wooden sculpture, known as the Madonna of Quays. &lsquo;Claire Sheridan', a well-known artist of the time, sculpted this famous model during late 50's. Presently, The Spanish Arch houses the Galway City Museum, which lies against one of its impressive walls. The current title of the Spanish Arch relates to the Irish merchant trade with Spain, whose sailboat often docked under its protection. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Spanish Arch","county":"Galway","category":"Monuments","images":["the-spanish-arch-0.jpg","222","156","the-spanish-arch-1.jpg","500","253","the-spanish-arch-2.jpg","500","374","the-spanish-arch-3.jpg","500","375","the-spanish-arch-4.jpg","500","375","the-spanish-arch-5.jpg","500","375"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"group":[{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The Painters Palette","county":"Galway","category":"Art Galleries","excerpt":"The Painter's Palette is dedicated to the proficient artist and writer Lynda Cookson.
