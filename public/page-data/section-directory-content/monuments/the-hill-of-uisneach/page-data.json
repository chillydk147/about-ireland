Located between the villages of Ballymore and  Loughanavally, the land covered by the hill spreads in a manner that four  neighboring town lands are brought together by it. Mweelra, Rathnew, Ushnagh  Hill and Kellybrook are part of the land on which this hill stands at a height  of 182 meters. </p>\n<p>If  Irish mythology is to be believed, a great stone once rested on it called Ail  na Míreann, which means 'stone of divisions' in the local language. The stone  acted as signpost to suggest the intersection of the provincial borders of  Leinster, Munster, Connacht, Ulster, and Mide. It also enjoyed considerable  importance in ancient Irish religious practices as the preferred site for  Druidical ceremonies and Beltane fires. The place finds mention in Geoffrey of  Monmouth’s ‘Historia Regum Britanniae’ and a book concerned with Irish  mythological beliefs.</p>\n<p>The  hill of Uisneach is given a lot of importance in both history and archeology.  Historians assumed that the site is the same as the one identified as Raiba or  Riba by Greek astronomer Ptolemy. Additionally, its premises include many  monuments covering an area of two square kilometers in the nearby town lands of  Kellybrook, Ushnagh and Rathnew. Enclosures and barrows, a possible megalithic  tomb and two ancient roads also fall within the specified area. All these make  the spectacular and magnificent hill of Uisneach a must-see place for those  interested in Irish history and legends.  </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Hill of Uisneach","county":"Westmeath","category":"Monuments","images":["the-hill-of-uisneach-2.jpg","490","368"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"group":[]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/section-directory-content/monuments/the-hill-of-uisneach/","county":"Westmeath","id":"efd77596-34d7-5c5e-904d-d2042d674757"}}}
