Poulnabrone Portal Tomb is one of the most famous Irish dolmens located in the  Burren, County Clare. Meaning the hole of sorrows, Poulnabrone Portal Tomb  dates back to the Neolithic era, 4200 BC to 2900 BC.</p>\n<p>The  most visible remains of the first full-time inhabitants of Burren who arrived  around 3800 BC are the megalithic tombs they constructed such as the  Poulnabrone Portal Tomb. Presenting the spectacular view, the dolmen has a  sloping capstone with two perfectly matching stones forming either walls. The  two slender portals are 6 feet above the ground that support the capstone which  is around 12 feet, thereby creating a 30 foot chamber in a low carin. In  addition, the entrance of the tomb is crossed by a low sill stone and it faces  north.</p>\n<p>In  1985, a crack was discovered in the eastern portal stone of the tomb that led  to dismantling of the dolmen for replacing the cracked stone. During this time,  excavations were done and it was founded that around 16 to 22 adults along with  6 children were buried under the Poulnabrone Portal Tomb. Personal items such  as polished stone ax, quartz crystals, weapons, pottery and a bone pendant were  also found buried with the dead. Body of a newborn baby was also found buried  outside the entrance of the tomb in the portico. All these facts unveiled that  the Poulnabrone Portal Tomb was the center of rituals and ceremony till the  Celtic period. </p>\n<p>The  enigma of the place and simplicity of the tomb makes it one of the world's most popular and visited dolmens.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Poulnabrone Portal Tomb","county":"Clare","category":"Monuments","images":["poulnabrone-portal-tomb-1.jpg","500","375","poulnabrone-portal-tomb-2.jpg","500","332","poulnabrone-portal-tomb-3.jpg","262","206","poulnabrone-portal-tomb-4.jpg","500","425"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"group":[{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The Doolin Cave","county":"Clare","category":"Caves","excerpt":"Doolin  Cave is fast emerging as one of the most significant eco-tourism sites in  Ireland.
