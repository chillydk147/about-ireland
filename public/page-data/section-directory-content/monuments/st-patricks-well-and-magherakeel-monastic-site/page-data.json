St. Patrick was an extraordinary man and his religion was  his solace. A devout Christian, he studied for 14 years to be a priest and  after that he returned back to Ireland. Spreading the Christian faith and  preaching Christianity was his only aim in life that he did for the next 30  years until his death on 17th March, 460AD. </p>\n<p>Saint  Patrick built number of churches across the country and wherever he went to  spread Christianity, he made that place holy. St. Patrick’s Well and  Magherakeel Monastic Site is one of the most important ecclesiastical centers  of Ireland.
