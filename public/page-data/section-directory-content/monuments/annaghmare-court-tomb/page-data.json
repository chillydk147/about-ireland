Commonly called Black Castle or Horned Cairn or Fort of the Dead (Gaelic &Aacute;th na Marbh), this court was excavated in the year 1963-64. Upon digging, it was found that this place, situated 2 miles north of Crossmaglen, was used for burying and cremating dead bodies. This was deduced as cremated and unburned human bones, flint scrapers, remains of late neolithic pottery vessels of Beacharra C and Sandhills characters, and bear's tooth were found here. Since bodies were cremated as well as buried in its three rectangular burial chambers, the court holds a distinct status, as only few other sites in Ireland were used for both purposes.</p>  \n    <p>The condition of this court tomb is surprisingly good, with all sites being quite well preserved. As there is no information about its creators in the local legends as well as folk songs, the gravity of the mystery associated with this ritualistic burial ground is accentuated. Furthermore, a stone situated to the south-east of the centre and the surprisingly large stones (up to 1.9 m high) also contribute in making this court quite unusual.</p>  \n    <p>The enclosing trapezoidal cairn, or mound made of earth, is 20 m long, 11.75 m wide in south and 6.5 m wide in north. On the other hand, the tomb court is 6 m deep and 4 m wide, with the walls possessing the post-and-panel building technique. Under this technique, all the sides of the forecourt are distinguished by alternating orthostats and dry stonewalling. This type of construction would certainly render the site with special acoustical properties, which may have played a role in the rituals.</p>  \n    <p>The 7 m long gallery begins with the two portal stones located at the centre, and is divided by a couple of jamb stones into three chambers. At the north end lie two lateral chambers having individual entrances, which were constructed after the other parts of the tomb were finished. The rough northern end reflects that another entrance was planned by the creators, even though it did not materialise due to unknown reasons. Behind the cairn lie two subsidiary graves that have given rise to many scary stories associated with this tomb court. During the excavation of 1963-64, a small erect stone was located on-site, but was later taken away. At this tomb court, a very small trench, measuring 0.3x0.34x0.75 m deep, was dug to place an information board.</p>  \n    <p>According to experts, this tomb was built around 3000-4000 B.C., around the same time when other such court tombs, numbering up to 400, were built between Ulster and north Connacht. Over the centuries, there have been many reports of ghostly apparitions at Annaghmare Court Tomb, which has further cemented its place among the scariest places of Ireland. However, tourists and enthusiasts of megalithic monuments have consistently thronged this site since excavation. Visitors can park their vehicles and go the site on foot or wheelchair through a well constructed concrete path.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Annaghmare Court Tomb","county":"Down","category":"Monuments","images":["annaghmare-court-tomb-1.jpg","400","212","annaghmare-court-tomb-2.jpg","500","375","annaghmare-court-tomb-3.jpg","500","375","annaghmare-court-tomb-4.jpg","400","256","annaghmare-court-tomb-6.jpg","500","341"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"group":[{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Bonita Art Gallery","county":"Down","category":"Art Galleries","excerpt":"Bonita Art Gallery is one of the famous Irish art galleries located in County Down Northern Ireland.
