Situated on small hillock in Northern Ireland, there are 22  carved sections of this sculpted stone cross which depict many scenes from both  the Old Testament and the New Testament. There is a legend associated with  Ardboe Old Cross, according to which it is thought to have been built around 9th  or 10th century. It is believed that a ‘Magic Cow’ which emerged  from the Lough Neagh gave lashings of cream, milk and butter to artisans and  others to help build the cross.   </p>\n<p>As  the first high cross built in Ulster and also the tallest in Northern Ireland,  it is given due respect as a national monument. One can also discover the  remains of a 16th century church and an abbey established by Saint  Coleman in the graveyard in 590. However, the highlight of this heritage site  that delights history lovers is its 3.5 feet wide and 18.5 feet high stone  which was originally a part of a monastery.</p>\n<p>Although  much of its beauty has been diminished over the years, Ardboe Old Cross is  still famous and is one of the most photographed high crosses in Ireland.  However, the hill on which it is located has not yet suffered the onslaught of  visitors and thus, retains its pristine peacefulness. This place attracts  attention of innumerable people every year, especially those interested history  and religion.        </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ardboe Old Cross","county":"Tyrone","category":"Monuments","images":["ardboe-old-cross-0.jpg","250","333","ardboe-old-cross-1.jpg","329","486","ardboe-old-cross-2.jpg","495","370","ardboe-old-cross-7.jpg","375","500","ardboe-old-cross-8.jpg","333","500","ardboe-old-cross-9.jpg","333","500"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"group":[{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Castlederg Castle","county":"Tyrone","category":"Castles","excerpt":"Lying on the estuary of River Derg, the ruined Castlederg Castle is a prominent site of the Castlederg village in county Tyrone.
