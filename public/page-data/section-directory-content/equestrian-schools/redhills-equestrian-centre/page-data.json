The centre is a family business and a place where students are taught to become BHSAI instructors. They are simultaneously given lessons for Road safety and Pony club examinations as well. Learning equestrian tricks at Redhills Equestrian Centre become all the more fun due to the pleasant hilly surroundings and the scenic beauty of the Redhills village. While visiting this equestrian school, one can perhaps also have a look at the location where the motion pictures &quot;The Run of the Country&quot; and &quot;The Playboys&rdquo; were shot. So, if one happens to be fond of horse riding, he or she must give this place a try.  </p>  \n    <ul> \n        <li>Facilities: Outdoor Arena (26m x 81m), Indoor Arena (30m x 45m),Cross Country Fences, Liveries, Tack Shop, Teaching to all Standards, Showjumping Training, Showjumping Competitions, Hacking, and Children's 3 day courses</li> </ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Redhills Equestrian Centre","county":"Cavan","category":"Equestrian Schools","images":["redhills-equestrian-centre-1.jpg","350","233","redhills-equestrian-centre-2.jpg","262","206","redhills-equestrian-centre-3.jpg","250","166"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"group":[{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Blacklion Golf Club","county":"Cavan","category":"Golf","excerpt":"The  beautiful picture painted on the natural landscape of Blacklion Golf Club by  mature trees and coppices of woodland makes it an ideal place for g..."},"fields":{"slug":"/section-directory-content/golf/blacklion-golf-club/"},"id":"16286c39-a4e1-50dc-9bae-708a1fa180ac"}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/section-directory-content/equestrian-schools/redhills-equestrian-centre/","county":"Cavan","id":"213e00b9-3df4-5003-8b58-5dda718d5dba"}}}
