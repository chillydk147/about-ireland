Besides these, the espaliered apples trees and a wisteria pergola are other features that define the formal structure of the garden. Built in the middle of lawns, mature trees and sweeping drives, the 1730s road house is the highlight of the property. The only thing that is likely to divert ones attention from it are the different species of plants like Hemerocallis, hollyhocks and climbing roses found in the garden. The fragrance emanating from the soil and the flowers is something one must take a whiff at when visiting the Hardymount Garden.</p>  \n    <ul> \n        <li>Opening Time: 2-6pm, Sun and Bank Holidays; during festival and also at other times by appointment for groups </li> \n        <li>Admission Charge: &euro;5 per person in aid of Cancer Research </li> </ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hardymount Garden","county":"Carlow","category":"Gardens","images":["hardymount-garden-0.jpg","500","250","hardymount-garden-1.jpg","333","500","hardymount-garden-2.jpg","262","206","hardymount-garden-3.jpg","400","266"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"group":[{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Clonmore Castle","county":"Carlow","category":"Castles","excerpt":"Located three and a half miles south of Hacketstown and nine miles east of Tullow in the north-east corner, Clonmore is a small village of County Carl..."},"fields":{"slug":"/section-directory-content/castles/clonmore-castle/"},"id":"be561bd9-a555-5e63-98de-e798f88443f8"}}]},{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Leinster Hills Golf Club","county":"Carlow","category":"Golf","excerpt":"Surrounded  by the majestically impressive mountain ranges of Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford,  Leinster Hills Golf Club located in County Carlow is a pop..."},"fields":{"slug":"/section-directory-content/golf/leinster-hills-golf-club/"},"id":"05168900-6694-5ae7-b09b-e5071105f495"}}]},{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Carlow County Museum","county":"Carlow","category":"Museums","excerpt":"Carlow County Museum is situated in the College Street adjoining the Tourist Office in Carlow Town.
