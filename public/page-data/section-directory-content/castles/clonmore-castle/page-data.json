This village derives its name from an Irish Word, Chluain Mh&oacute;r, which means &quot;Mogue's large meadow&quot;. The village is named after St. Mogue, who founded a religious community and constructed a monastery in the village. The Clonmore Castle is a prominent attraction of the village, which is 12th century fortress but has no mentioned existence until the mid 14th century. The masonry and shape of the trefoil window in the south wall reflect that this majestic monument was erected in the late 13th century.</p>  \n    <p>Archaeological studies reveal that the Clonmore Castle was probably built in the twelfth century. It is believed that the Anglo-Norman family, Butler of Ormonde laid the foundations of this grand estate. It was preceded by the construction of a motte and bailey. Being a fortified building of timber, the castle stands on a man-made high conical mound and is surrounded by water. Situated about half a mile to the east of the castle, the existing motte is connected to the Castle through an underground passage. </p>  \n    <p>According to the legends, this castle has witnessed numerous warfare and ravages of the time. The castle was discovered in 1332, when Sir Anthony de Lucy got it rebuilt and renovated. In the early 15th century, the Clonmore Castle was captured by the Earl of Kildare and later in 1598; the Earl of Ormond took over it. Until the mid 16th century, the power and control over the castle shifted numerous time between the two Earl's. In 1650, Oliver Cromwell's forces under Colonel Hewson invaded and took over this ancient manor. </p>  \n    <p>The Clonmore Castle is spread over a wide square area with rectangular towers erected at two southern corners and modest turrets at other two corners of the courtyard. The remnant of the main interior building including the windows, stairway, chambers and narrow passages are preserved on the eastern side of the courtyard. The eastern range of the hall comprises the south east tower. At the ground floor, the hall has been barrel-vaulted with two storeys above it. The north-east angle of the tower incorporates a large garderobe. Moreover, the towers at the corner of courtyard reflect similar barrel-vaults. However, the close examination of the masonry and other features of the interior building are not possible as this historic structure is now overgrown. Presently, the major part of the castle has been demolished for the construction of local amenities and sites including the neighbouring hall and schoolhouses.</p>  \n    <p>Some of the interesting features of this remnant monument include the gargoyle, popularly known as 'Pooka Head', which is positioned at the top of the south-east tower. The base of the south-east tower features a 'lintel of the doorway', which has a cross carved in its relief. This relief is a grave slab, which has been re-used from the early monastery flourishing during the sixth century in Clonmore.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Clonmore Castle","county":"Carlow","category":"Castles","images":["clonmore-castle-0.jpg","400","300","clonmore-castle-1.jpg","500","375","clonmore-castle-2.jpg","400","267","clonmore-castle-3.jpg","500","375","clonmore-castle-5.jpg","262","206","clonmore-castle-6.jpg","500","375"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"group":[{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Hardymount Garden","county":"Carlow","category":"Gardens","excerpt":"Hardymount Garden is a place in County Carlow, Ireland which entices one to visit it by offering views from grass paths and of a lily pond as part of..."},"fields":{"slug":"/section-directory-content/gardens/hardymount-garden/"},"id":"39f3cf5b-9d50-5252-8e99-9fc0d048b6ac"}}]},{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Leinster Hills Golf Club","county":"Carlow","category":"Golf","excerpt":"Surrounded  by the majestically impressive mountain ranges of Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford,  Leinster Hills Golf Club located in County Carlow is a pop..."},"fields":{"slug":"/section-directory-content/golf/leinster-hills-golf-club/"},"id":"05168900-6694-5ae7-b09b-e5071105f495"}}]},{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Carlow County Museum","county":"Carlow","category":"Museums","excerpt":"Carlow County Museum is situated in the College Street adjoining the Tourist Office in Carlow Town.
