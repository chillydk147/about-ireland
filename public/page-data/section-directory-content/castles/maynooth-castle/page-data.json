The English army bombarded the huge castle in March 1535 under  the command of William Skeffington. Much of the medieval structure of the  castle was ruined by the heavy modern siege guns used by them. Even after its  restoration by the eleventh Earl of Kildare in 1552 and reparations in 1630,  the castle could not tolerate the blows dealt to it by the Confederates in  1641. Nevertheless, tourists are allowed restricted access to this ruined  castle so as to enable them to form a mental picture of the glorious past of  the castle. The entrance gate and hall-keep still stand as reminder of the long-gone  days of grandeur that may have been witnessed by the Maynooth Castle. Along  with these, the eastern walls and towers have also withstood the test of time. </p>\n<p>There  is a high possibility that the site formerly belonged to an earlier castle  built by Gerald FitzMaurice, one of Strongbow's associates. As for the present  day, the castle can be found standing next to the entrance of the NUI Maynooth  South Campus. This combination of a modern feel with the old world charm adds  to the appeal of the place. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Maynooth Castle","county":"Kildare","category":"Castles","images":["maynooth-castle-4.jpg","262","206"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"group":[{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Castlewarden Pony and Country Club","county":"Kildare","category":"Equestrian Schools","excerpt":"Located between the townlands of Oughterard and Steelstown, Castlewarden Pony and Country Club is rested in the plains of Kildare.
