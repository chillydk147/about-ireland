Oranmore Castle situated in Oranmore town of County Galway showcases the  history of this European country, Ireland with its unique elegance. Built  possibly on the site of an older castle, Oranmore Castle belongs to the 15th  century. This castle was under the strong hold of a well-known Norman family of  Galway  Clanricardes. Galway was under the control of the fifth Earl  Clanricarde and the Marquess in the year 1641. In the year 1642, during the  month of March, the Oranmore town joined the Confederate Ireland in a rebel  against which the owners held out.</p>\n<p>Until  1643 Clanricarde provisioned the Fort of Galway from the sea, thereafter  Governor of Galway  Captain Willoughby surrendered both castle and fort without  the consent of Marquess. In 1651, the Oranmore Castle was surrendered to  Parliamentary forces. Though the entire Marquess property was forfeited, his  successor, the 6th Earl, got back most part of the property  including the castle. The castle was then leased to Walter Athy in the year  1666, which was subsequently passed on to his descendents until 1853.   </p>\n<p>In  the year 1947, Oranmore Castle was purchased by Lady Leslie for £200 who got the  castle reroofed as it had fallen into disrepair. Two story wings were added to  the castle by Lady Leslie’s daughter. Viewed as outrageous, the castle was set  alight in 1964 to provide heat during winters, due to which the new roof was  reduced to ashes.</p>\n<p>The  Oranmore Castle is a rectangular tower house with four stories, a square  staircase turret and gunloops on the bottom floor, presenting a mesmerizing  view to the visitors.  </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Oranmore Castle","county":"Galway","category":"Castles","images":["oranmore-castle-0.jpg","320","240","oranmore-castle-1.jpg","219","300","oranmore-castle-2.jpg","250","188","oranmore-castle-3.jpg","500","375","oranmore-castle-4.jpg","500","332"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"group":[{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The Painters Palette","county":"Galway","category":"Art Galleries","excerpt":"The Painter's Palette is dedicated to the proficient artist and writer Lynda Cookson.
