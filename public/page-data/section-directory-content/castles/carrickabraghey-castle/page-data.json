Though the year in which this castle was constructed is not known, it is widely accepted that it was built before the 17th century by Phelemy Brasleigh O&rsquo;Doherty. When translated into English, its name becomes Castlebrack, which literally means stone fortification with speckled appearance. It can be reached by driving past Ballyliffin, and continuing till the ruins of this castle come to sight. Though it can be viewed clearly from Derry-Letterkenny Road, this castle is located on private lands, and thus cannot be accessed. This splendid structure overlooking the beach has been devoid of occupants since 1665. </p>  \n    <p>During the time between 9th and 13th century, Inishowen was trifurcated into Aileach, Bredach and Carraic Brachaidhe. In due course of time, the latter area located in the western regions became known as Carrickabraghey. Back then, the land was quite similar to an island, with only a small portion of land connecting it to mainland, though it is deemed to be a peninsula now. The castle has been built with seven circular towers and an oval bawn, both of which enclosed a keep between themselves. Presently, several sandhills are located south of the bawn, while a tower is situated south of the keep and is thought to have belonged to the church at some point of time. It is generally believed that this structure covered a lot more area than, up to the points where new buildings are presently located.</p>  \n    <p>One of the prominent features of this castle is the Hissing Rock, a crack in a rock that spurts water when the tide is full, providing an excellent sight for all nature-lovers. Having walls that are 3&rsquo;9&rdquo; wide, this castle provides an excellent view of the Glasheedy Island as well as waves from Atlantic Ocean crashing in on the shore. Pollan Strand, where the bloody 16th century battle for the lordship of Inishowen can be seen from the loops of this castle. The areas located nearby are also well known, especially the Doagh Famine Village and Santa&rsquo;s Lapland, with the land known to have been occupied since 800 A.D.</p>  \n    <p>It has had many occupants over the years, and was the stronghold of the Clan O&rsquo;Dochertaigh, to whom the builder of this castle belonged. This castle clearly depicts the Inch and Burt construction that O&rsquo;Doherty used extensively for defence purposes. Being placed in seclusion made this castle the best place for him to plan his famous revolt. During the times of war, the Hovenden Brothers were commissioned here to fight the Spanish Armada. Another battle that this castle witnessed was the one when the English unsuccessfully attacked the rebels of Sir Cahir O&rsquo;Doherty. Even Mc Faul, one of the descendants of Prince Eoghain, son of Niall and the nine hostages, also held charge of this building at one point of time. Another famous occupant of this structure was Sir Arthur Chichester, when he was awarded the whole of Inishowen by the Crown.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Carrickabraghey Castle","county":"Donegal","category":"Castles","images":["carrickabraghey-castle-1.jpg","500","332","carrickabraghey-castle-2.jpg","500","333","carrickabraghey-castle-3.jpg","500","389","carrickabraghey-castle-4.jpg","300","210","carrickabraghey-castle-5.jpg","500","334","carrickabraghey-castle-6.jpg","500","373","carrickabraghey-castle-8.jpg","400","500"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"group":[{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Donegal Art Gallery","county":"Donegal","category":"Art Galleries","excerpt":"Opened in the year 1997, Donegal Art Gallery is located in Upper Main Street in Donegal Town.
