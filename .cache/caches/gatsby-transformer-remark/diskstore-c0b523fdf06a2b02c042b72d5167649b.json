This Ballydehob gallery is harbored in the rugged yet impressive western Cork landscape. It is thus not only the art, but also the natural beauty of the place which pulls visitors towards it. Those with a keen eye for art will most likely appreciate the works of Donagh Carey, Eadaoin Harding Kemp and Bill Griffin. The gallery is an ideal place to spend a splendid day with dear ones or to give oneself a visual treat, especially if one happens to be an art collector.</p>  \n    <ul> \n        <li>Opening Time: Tuesday &ndash; Saturday (11am &ndash; 6pm)</li> \n        <li>Facilities: Members Club, The Portable Gallery, Private Viewings, Nationwide Delivery, Commissions, Deposits Taken </li> </ul>"}
