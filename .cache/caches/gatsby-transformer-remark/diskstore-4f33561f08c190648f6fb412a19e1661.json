It neither charges any entry fee nor is it difficult to find since it lies in the center of the province, near to the town of Dungannon. For the convenience of family groups and even casual walkers, the walks in the area have been marked throughout. One can spot a variety of deciduous and conifer trees which had been planted in the area a long time ago. The naturalness promotes the place as the habitat of several species of animals, plants and insects.</p>  \n    <ul> \n        <li>Facilities: Open all the year round, forest guides on request for youth and adult groups, camping and caravan </li> </ul>"}
