The Ballymacscanlon hotel is in a heavily treed spot at the back of the road of the legendary Cooley Peninsula. This peninsula is a hilly peninsula in County Louth, which is home to towns such as Omeath, Carlingford and Greenore. Proleek Dolmen is one of the most significant portal dolmens in this county of Ireland. The name 'Dolmen&rsquo; has been derived from a French word 'tolmen', which means &lsquo;stone table&rsquo;. </p>  \n    <p>The Proleek Dolmen, also known as the portal tomb, comprises a chamber, which faces towards the north-west. Portal tomb is an archaeological term, which means 'a doorway'. This dolmen has derived its name from this term because of the belief that two large upright stones act as a portal into the burial chamber. It is also believed that Portal Dolmen was once covered with a man-made pile of stones. This megalithic dolmen, which measures 3.8 metre by 3.2 metre, is estimated to be 35 tonnes in weight. Moreover, this substantial capstone is supported on two front or portal stones, which are about 2.3 metre high. It also has a back stone, which is 1.8 metre high and is buttressed with a concrete and rock reinforcement.</p>  \n    <p>Dating back to 4000-1500 BC, archaeological studies reveal that this monument was built and used by populace, who inhabited Ireland in Neolithic and early Bronze Age. Collective remains of individuals and fragmentary remains of pottery vessels, simple ornaments and stone implements were yielded after the excavation of the tomb by Wright in 1740's. According to a folklore legend, the distinguishing attribute of this site is that a wish is granted to whoever succeeds in throwing a pebble to the top of the capstone. Moreover, it is also believed that this &lsquo;Giant&rsquo;s Load&rsquo; was carried to Ireland by a Scottish giant named, Parrah Boug McShagean, who is buried nearby. Proleek Dolmen is one of the finest examples of the neolithic art of Irish town and is widely photographed and documented. Access to the dolmen is through the grounds of a hotel, from where it resembles a thick-stemmed mushroom with warts. The &ldquo;warts&rdquo; being the pebbles that visitors have tossed onto the cap.</p>  \n    <p>Close to the site is a Bronze Age wedge gallery tomb. This tomb is so named because of its shape of a wedge. Tourists visiting Proleek Dolmen have to pass this gallery tomb, which is 6 metre in length and 1.5 metre wide at the west end. Extending to a metre wide at the east end, this majestic gallery is covered by two roof stones, which bear a bright orange lichen. A corridor was formed by the two parallel walls of rectangular stone slabs that were covered with a line of capstones and a barrow or a cairn. It is believed that the major part of this gallery tomb was built during the fourth millennium BC, though some of its part was built in the Bronze Age.</p>"}
