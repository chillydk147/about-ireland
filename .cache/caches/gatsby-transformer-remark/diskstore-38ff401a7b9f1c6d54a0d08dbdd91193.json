Ardglass Castle is one of the most visited castles of Ireland that attracts many tourists throughout the year. The  castle was built in County Down of Northern Ireland in the 15th  century. Picturesquely located on the shore of a little harbor, the Ardglass  Castle was perhaps a row of warehouses.  </p>\n<p>An  array of fortified warehouses dating back to the 12th century is  known as the Newark, which was acquired by Lord Charles Fitzgerald in the year  1790. He was the one who converted the central section of the row of warehouses  into Ardglass Castle. This castle was sold by him to William Ogilvie in the  year 1806. The property was subsequently passed on to his son-in-law Charles  Beauclerc. Charles Beauclerc was bankrupted in year 1896 after which the  grounds and the castle were bought by a group of local men who wished to start  a golf club there.</p>\n<p>The  castle includes three square towers, out of which one stands in the center and  one at each end. The array of the warehouses was supposed to provide 13 spaces  behind the quay which were guarded by towers at each end. These were assumed to  be utilized as a passage for the residents or for the visiting merchants to  County Down  Till date, large sections of the original buildings can still be  seen, apart from the Ardglass Castle which has been converted to a golf  clubhouse since 18th century. </p>","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":3,"column":513,"offset":1508}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":3,"column":513,"offset":1508}}}}
