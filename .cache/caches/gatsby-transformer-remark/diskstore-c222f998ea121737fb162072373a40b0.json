The 18 holes golf  course of this club is built as parkland and comprises several mature trees.  The picture-perfect beauty of the serene environs makes the golfing experience  at this club all the more pleasurable. While golfing, the magnificently  impressive sights of Longford town are very hard to ignore.   </p>\n<p>One  has to stay alert while playing a round of the game in this golf course that  has a par score of 72 and spreads over 6700 yards. This is because a stream  comes into play at many holes, not sparing even the last one. In addition to  this, other water hazards have also been added to spice up the game and make it  more challenging; especially the signature 13th hole. </p>\n<p>Apart  from the golfing course, there are other means of relaxation provided by the  club through its club house, bar and Pro Shop.
