The exhibitions held at the gallery feature either local scenes of County Donegal or local artist. Initially the building was bought in 1993 and was turned into a stationary/supplies shop &ldquo;The Desk and Easel&rdquo; and an insurance brokerage. This shop gradually became the leading art supplier in South West Donegal and had a regular clientele of artists from Kilcar, Carrick, Ardara, Glencolmcille and many other places. In addition, in 1994 some of artworks by customers were also displayed in the insurance office and in the shop. Successful acknowledgment of the artworks by the visitors led to the establishment of the gallery, as larger space was needed to showcase the works of artists. </p>  \n    <p>&middot;         Facilities:</p> \n    <p>&middot;         Art Class : Running months: September and May in five weeks block </p> \n    <p>&middot;         Evening Timings: 7:30 pm to 10:00 pm</p> \n    <p>&middot;         Days: Monday- Oil, Tuesday- Acrylic</p> \n    <p>&middot;         Afternoon Classes: Saturday&ndash;Oil</p> \n    <p>&middot;         Charges: &euro;55 per set of 5 classes (including: tea/coffee each week) </p> \n    <p>&middot;         Additional facilities:</p> \n    <p>&middot;         Booking of Gallery for daily or weekly classes</p> \n    <p>&middot;         Arranging tutor along with all the materials</p> \n    <p>&middot;         Accommodation and meals arrangement on request</p> \n    <p>&middot;         Opening Time: Monday to Saturday (9am to 6pm)</p>","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":12,"column":74,"offset":1605},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":12,"column":74,"offset":1605}}}}
