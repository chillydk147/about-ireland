Till date there are no  evidences to prove that who built the castle but mostly believe that either  Meyler FitzHenry or Strongbow constructed this marvelous castle. </p>\n<p>The site of the castle was in the hands of Dermot McMurrough  Kavanagh on the arrival of the Normans in County Laois. Through the marriage of  his daughter the castle was given to Richard fitz Gilbert de Clare, also known  as Strongbow. Subsequently, with the marriage of Strongbow’s daughter and heir,  Isabel with William Marshal, Dunamase Castle passed into the hands of the  Marshal family. The ownership of the castle changed hands between the Irish  O’Mores and English many times in the following years, until it was finally  handed over to the Cromwellian. In 1215, the castle was mentioned for first  time when Geoffery Lutterel was ordered by King John to hand it to William. </p>\n<p>The history of diverse ownership of Dunamase Castle did not end  soon; in the 17th century Sir John Parnell partially refurbished the  place as his residence. In the later part of the 18th century, he  started constructing a banqueting hall within the ruins and included medieval  architectural details taken from areas. However, with the demise of Sir John  Parnell, his son allowed the castle to ruin. With its rich and interesting  historical background, the Dunamase Castle is one of the most treasured castles  of Ireland.</p>","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":3,"column":535,"offset":1587}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":3,"column":535,"offset":1587}}}}
