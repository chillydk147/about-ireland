Named Donamon or  Dun Lomghuin, meaning the fortress of Lomghuin, this castle stands on a raised  ground. The earliest reference to this spectacular castle has been found in the  Annals of the Four Masters, which dates back to 1154. The site on which the  castle stands has been referred to as the seat of the O'Finaghtys and was later  on passed on to the Burkes. </p>\n<p>After  few decades, in 1656, the Donamon Castle was bought by one of the henchmen of  Cromwell, Robert King of Rickingham. Later on, in 1668 the castle was leased to  Thomas Caulifield by Lord Kingston, who was son of the King. The castle was  once under the control of an IRA unit led by Seán McCool and Mick Price, with  the aim to establish a training camp. Centuries later, precisely in the year  1939, the castle was bought by the Divine Word Missionaries from Germany. At  that point in time, the Donamon Castle was in a ruinous condition and even the  garden a wilderness. </p>\n<p>Years  later, OCA conducted a comprehensive survey and prepared detailed drawings of  the existing structures of this 14th century fortified residence.  Thereafter, Mary O’Carroll was assigned the task of refurbishing the castle as  well the 19th century extensions. With renovation, everything was  restored to render grandeur to the Donamon Castle. At present, the Donamon  Castle that overlooks River Suck is a popular historical landmark of Roscommon  that attracts tourists year-round.</p>","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":3,"column":498,"offset":1610}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":3,"column":498,"offset":1610}}}}
