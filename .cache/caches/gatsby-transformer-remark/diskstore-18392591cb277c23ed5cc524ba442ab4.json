The first of these Irish beaches is situated at the bottom of  Slievemore Mountain. The latter, with its sandy dunes and grasses, can be found  as one goes towards East. Presiding over Blacksod Bay, Dugort has been a  tourist spot ever since the establishment of Slievemore Hotel (formerly the  Achill Mission Hotel, and now private apartments) in 1839. The hotel was part  of the culture that the village was introduced to by the Protestant colonizers  from England. St. Thomas's Church, contemporary field systems and rows of  terraced houses are some of the other reminders of the Colony that one can  visit while visiting Dugort.   </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Facilities: Hotel with restaurant, coffee  shop and a popular bar-restaurant</li>\n</ul>","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":4,"column":6,"offset":913},"indent":[1,1,1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":4,"column":6,"offset":913}}}}
