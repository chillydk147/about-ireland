This white sandy beach sprawls between the slope of Croaghaun  Mountain and Moyteoge Head while being set in a wonderful horseshoe-shaped bay.  Located on the western edge of Achill Island, Keem beach is protected  physically by the steep mountains on the left and right and metaphorically by  St. Patrick’s blessing. If Irish legends are to be believed, when St. Patrick  set his eyes on the gleaming beach at Keem, he prophesied that no one would  ever drown in its waters. In the present times, the beach is made safe by  lifeguards thereby making it an ideal place for swimming on a hot summer  day.               </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Activities: Water-Sports such as  Snorkeling, Scuba Diving and Surfing  </li>\n</ul>","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":4,"column":6,"offset":819},"indent":[1,1,1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":4,"column":6,"offset":819}}}}
