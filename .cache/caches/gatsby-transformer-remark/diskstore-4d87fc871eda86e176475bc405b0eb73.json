The  mesmerizingly picturesque view visible from its premises makes it one of the  most popular golfing destinations in Ireland. </p>\n<p>It would rather be  unfair if one was to miss out on the extraordinary sights visible from 16th  tee of the course. With Dun Laoghaire, Bray and County Wicklow to the South and  County Dublin and County Louth to the North, one can expect nothing less than  amazing sight-seeing. One should not fail to notice the impressive scenes of  the city of Dublin either. The visibility of Mountains of Mourne in County Down  is also a possibility on a day when the sky happens to be clear. The Sea on the  Eastern side only adds to the visual treat while witnessing the wealth put on  display by nature at this place.</p>\n<p>One gets to see a  great example of James Braid’s architectural talents at the 5th  hole. It shows how an impressive golf hole can be fit into the distinct Howth  heathers by an architect who knows his job well. The dog leg design golf holes  observed here are, in fact, one of the chief characteristics of his style and  give a visitor another reason to include this club on his itinerary, apart from  the love of golf. </p>","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":3,"column":429,"offset":1355},"indent":[1,1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":3,"column":429,"offset":1355}}}}
