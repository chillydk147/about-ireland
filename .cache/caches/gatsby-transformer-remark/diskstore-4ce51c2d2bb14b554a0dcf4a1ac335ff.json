Historically, tower houses were the buttress residences, which were vested with power and authoritative control over the surrounding lands. The name of the castle has been anglicised from the Gaelic Achadh na nIubhar, which means the field of yews, one of the old specimen remains nearby. </p>  \n    <p>Aughnanure Castle is situated on the banks of the River Drimneed, which flows gently beneath the low cliff on which this castle stands. This gives access to the boats to come right up to the gate of this ancient citadel. River Drimneed flows into the wester side of Lough Corrib exactly 2 miles from Oughterard. This majestic castle was built by wealthy land owning Gaelic families from the Anglo-Norman populace.</p>  \n    <p>This Tower House with battlements in Irish styles is believed to have been built in the late 16th century by the O'Flahertys, which were one of Connacht's respected lord families. Until 1572, the authority of the castle was under the O'Flaherty chieftains. Later, Sir Edward Fitton, who was the President of Connaught, captured and granted this castle to a member of the clan, who had been coaxed over to the Crown. The castle was used as a barrier by Galway locals during the Cromwellian invasion. Later in the 15th century, this ancient site was granted to the Earl of Clanrickard. Soon after, O'Flahertys reclaimed the site from the Earl of Clan Rickard. As the result of the foreclosure of a mortgage, the power and control of this site later vested with Lord St. George. </p>  \n    <p>Standing on a rocky Peninsula, the castle is a well preserved example of an Irish Tower house, which is perfectly described as &ldquo;the finest fortified dwelling upon any part of the shores of Lough Corrib&rdquo;. The mammoth rectangular Tower House is protected from inside by two alls or enclosures. The wedge-shaped inner enclosure has stone walls pierced with gun-ports. The north-western corner of the castle presents the remains of the gatehouse and drawbridge. Drimneed River, which flows through the northern side of the castle, adds a natural defence line. On the other hand, lying to the east and south is the outer irregular enclosure, which is protected by an extensive outer bawn wall. This bawn wall has five wall towers equally distant along its length, which were used to shoot the attackers from a variety of angles.</p>  \n    <p>The inner bawn and tower house on the west are beautifully structured with a natural bridge of rock as the entrance. Aughnanure Castle is a six-storey castle with a gracefully battered base. The two flanking bar tizans at the third storey impart a picturesque appearance to the castle. Over the forth storey is a well-built vault. There is a large hall in the fifth storey of the castle, which is beautifully structured with wide mullioned windows and a scintillating fireplace. There is a tier of mural chambers and a spiral stair case, along the thickness of the east wall, which gives access to all the storeys. The modern hipped roof of the Castle with machicolation parapets, commands a picturesque view of the nearby Lough Corrib. </p>"}
