It is one of the most beautiful places to visit in County Limerick.  This castle, whose existence can be traced back to 1199, is one of the most  prominent monuments of Askeaton town. Established by William de Burgo, the  castle even had the privilege to be the abode of the King of Munster at one  point in history.</p>\n<p>As  often happens in case of desirable properties, Askeaton Castle has also been  subject to different ownerships by various people. Before falling in the hands  of King Edward II, it was in possession of Thomas De Clare in 1287. King Edward  II subsequently bestowed the property on Robert de Welle in 1318. From 1348, the  castle became the chief living place of the Earls of Desmond. The present day  structure of the castle has its roots in the 15th century  architecture.</p>\n<p>The  castle came under the control of English in 1642 when it was captured by  Colonel Purcell to disable the disloyal Desmond from challenging English  supremacy. However, the Cromwellian troops were the ones who were blame worthy  for the downfall of Askeaton Castle in 1652. </p>\n<p>Nevertheless,  the castle still proves to be one of the most appreciated architectural  examples that extends over two courtyards. Other things that capture attention  are the celebrated banqueting hall, 15th-century hall and chamber block.  Additionally, the beautifully carved windows are another striking feature of  the castle. This magnificent castle is regarded as the finest secular building  of its time by many that attracts tourists year-round.</p>"}
