Although  the cave has been known to exist for ages, yet it is only in recent times that  the interest has been shown in unearthing its history. The importance enjoyed  by this cave in some scientific and historical research ventures makes many  visit this place.</p>\n<p>Some  of the finest calcite formations that exist in Ireland are present in Dunmore  Cave. Comprising a chain of chambers formed over a period of about 3000 million  years, it stretches over almost a quarter of a mile with its deepest point at  150 feet underneath the surface. As sun-rays cannot reach so deep, one will  find limited flora and fauna inside this cave. Nevertheless, the cave did  support a bat colony at one point of time which is evident from the bat  skeletons that can still be seen encrusted on the surface.  </p>\n<p>With  the intention to facilitate access and viewing, the cave has been endowed with  lighting system, stairs and walkways. These improvements have been made after  the cave became a public property in 1940 and declared a national monument.  However, wheelchair users cannot visit the place despite these changes. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Facilities: Restaurant, Car Park, Coach  Park and Disabled Access</li>\n  <li>Opening Times:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>         \n    Mid March - Mid June: Daily  10:00-17:00<br />\n    Mid June - Mid September: Daily  09:30-18:30<br />\n    Mid September – October: Daily  10:00-17:00<br />\n    Winter Sat, Sun and Bank holidays:  10:00-16:30 <br />\n    Last admission 45 minutes before  closing </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Visit Length: 1hr and 30mins </li>\n  <li>Admission: </li>\n</ul>\n<p>         \n    Adult- EUR 2.75<br />\n    Child- EUR 1.25<br />\n    Student- EUR 1.25 <br />\n    Senior- EUR 2.00 <br />\n    Family- EUR 7.00 <br />\n    Group- EUR2.00 </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Information: Leaflets, Guided Tours, Audio  Visual and Exhibition</li>\n</ul>","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":27,"column":6,"offset":2046},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":27,"column":6,"offset":2046}}}}
