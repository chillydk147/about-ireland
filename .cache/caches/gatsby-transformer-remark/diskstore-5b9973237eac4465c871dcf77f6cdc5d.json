Besides these, the espaliered apples trees and a wisteria pergola are other features that define the formal structure of the garden. Built in the middle of lawns, mature trees and sweeping drives, the 1730s road house is the highlight of the property. The only thing that is likely to divert ones attention from it are the different species of plants like Hemerocallis, hollyhocks and climbing roses found in the garden.
