<p>The castles of Ireland remind of the glorious past of the country and are among the  most visited tourist destinations. Birr Castle is an edifice situated in the  town of Birr in County Offaly. It is the current residence of the 7th  Earl of Rosse, William Brendan Parsons unlike the other castles that have  ruined over the years. </p>
<p>Founded  by St. Brendan, Birr gets its name from Biorra, an ancient abbey. With history  dating back to 1170, the castle was under the control of O’ Carroll family from  14th to 17th century, who ruled over an area known as Ely  O’Carroll. The castle along with 1277 acres of land was granted to Sir Laurence  Parsons after the death of Sir Charles O’Carroll. Parsons appointed English  masons for the construction of a new castle on the site. Birr Castle was then  passed on to William, younger son of Sir Laurence Parsons after his death and  death of his elder son Richard. During the time of Irish Rebellion of 1641,  William was besieged by Catholic forces for fifteen months. After the civil war  ended, Laurence, William’s son refurnished the entire Birr Castle. </p>
<p>The  ground of Birr Castle is home to Ireland’s Historic Science Center, with  visitors coming to observatory from all over the world. The 3rd Earl  of Rosse, William Parsons was responsible for the construction of the great  telescope at the castle. The building in which the telescope was placed can  still be seen in the park, whereas the telescope has been shifted to the  Science Museum in London.  </p>
<p>Though  the residential areas of the Birr Castle are not open to the public, they can  still relish the splendid beauty of the gardens and the grounds of the demesne. </p>
