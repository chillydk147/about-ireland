<p>Situated in the Irish Midlands, County  Roscommon is a peaceful area with some of the glorious cultural attractions and  well preserved rich historical sites. The historical treasures of the county  include remains of historical buildings and castles such as the Roscommon  Castle. Roscommon Castle, situated north of Roscommon Town, is a magnificent  Norman castle. The castle was built by Justiciciar of Ireland, Robert de Ufford  in 1296 on the land seized by him from the Augustinian Priory. </p>
<p>Besieged in 1272 by Aodh O’Connor, Connacht  King, Roscommon Castle has the most diversified history till date. The castle  was passed again into the hands of an English garrison after eight years and  was fully restored. O’Connors regained the possession of Roscommon Castle by  1340 and was under his possession for two centuries until 1569. After this, the  castle was seized by Lord Deputy, Sir Henry Ford and in 1578 it was granted to  Sir Nicholas Malby, the English Governor of Connacht. During this period, the  castle was made into a modern Elizabethan mansion by constructing splendid  manor house on the north and east sides of the courtyard, with addition of  mullioned windows. </p>
<p>The Parliamentarian faction held the castle  till 1641 and by 1645 it was captured by Confederate Catholics under Preston.  Till 1652, the castle remained under Irish control till the time it was  surrendered to the Cromwellian 'Ironsides'. Eventually the magnificent  Roscommon Castle was burned down in 1690.      </p>
<p>Roscommon Castle, now in ruins, is  quadrangular in plan with a double towered entrance gate and round bastions at  the corners. Still presenting a remarkable sight, the Castle is a must visit as  it takes back to the history of County Roscommon  </p>
