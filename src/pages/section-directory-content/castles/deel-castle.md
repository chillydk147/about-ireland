<p>Deel  Castle also meaning the Castle of the River Deel was built by the Bourkes in 16th  century. This marvelous castle is located near the town of Crossmolina, County  Mayo in Ireland. After Colonel Thomas Bourke had fought the Williamite Wars on  the side of King James the castle was fortified and given to the Gore Family.  Renamed Castle Gore, the Deel Castle has withstood the test of time and still  looks marvelous.</p>
<p>The  tower-house of the castle had a large C. I 8 wings along a rusticated doorway  added to it along with the C.17 range. Moreover, the front of the Deel Castle  was edged by a wall and a low office range, which probably comprised the old  bawn. By the end of 18th century, Deel Castle was leased to James  Cuff, Lord Tyrawley along with other lands. In 1791, he built a house besides  the old Bourke Castle which was severely damaged during the Rebellion of 1798. However,  in the year 1922, the house was burnt and was never rebuilt. </p>
<p>The  Deel Castle also known as the Castle Gore was left to the illegitimate son of  Lord Tyrawley, Colonel James Cuff who outraged the whole country by keeping a  French mistress there. The estate of the castle was again under the hold of the  Earls of Arran after the death of James Cuff. Intact till the early 20th  century, the Deel Castle no longer retains its original form. The Deel Castle,  although in ruins, is one of the most attractive places to visit in  Ireland.Â  </p>
