<p>The Blarney Castle, situated near the River Martin, is one of Ireland’s classic  tourist destinations. Picturesque location of the castle on the edge of a cliff  makes it one of the greatest architectural treasures of Ireland. </p>
<p>The  Blarney Castle,was built in the 10th century and was originally a  timber hunting lodge, which was later replaced by a stone castle in 1210. The  present day construction of the Blarney Castle,was completed in the year 1446  by the King of Munster, Dermot McCarthy. The Castle belonged to the McCarthy  family until the year 1646 when Oliver Cromwell arrived at the place and took  over its possession. Fifteen years after enthroning of King Charles II years,  McCarthy took over the Blarney Castle,again. After losing the battle of the  Boyne in the year 1690, McCarthy was stripped of his powers and was forced to  leave the Castle. Later, in 1703 the Castle was sold to the Governor of Cork   Sir James Jefferyes. The Blarney Castle,is now owned and managed by the Trustees  of the Blarney Castle,Estate.</p>
<p>Besides  the history of the magnificent Castle, there is a legend attached to this  majestic place. The Blarney stone that lies at the top turret of the Castle is  believed to have magical powers and it is said that whosoever kisses the stone  is endowed with the gift of eloquence. This stone is half of the Stone of Scone  which was gifted to McCarthy by Robert the Bruce in 1314 for his support in the  Battle of Bannockburn. The stone that was gifted originally belonged to Scotland  where the Scottish Kings were crowned over this stone which was believed to  have special powers.</p>
<p>The  Blarney Castle,is surrounded by beautiful gardens of exquisite shrubs, trees  and flowers and a clear water lake, creating a fairytale picture. The tall  towers of the Castle set within these gardens contain some whimsically named natural rock formations such as  Druid’s Circle, the Wishing Steps and the Witch’s Cave. Nearby the Blarney  Castle is the Blarney House. This Scottish baronial-style mansion is now open  for the public and those who come here do not miss the chance to visit this  spectacular house. </p>
<p>A  look at the spectacular Blarney Castle,makes everyone wish to come back to this  magnificent and splendid masterpiece again and again. </p>
