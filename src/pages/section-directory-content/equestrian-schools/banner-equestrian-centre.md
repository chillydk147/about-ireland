<p>Banner Equestrian Centre is a family run business which is approved by the British Horse Society. It sprawls over 100 acres of rugged countryside and largely uninhabited woods of the Burren Region.

While on a trek in the region, one not just unburdens the load of daily life hassles but can also spot some of the best Irish wildlife.</p>  
    <p>As for the facilities provided at the centre, they are designed in a manner that shall give horse riders the kind of pleasure they seek. So, if one wants to indulge in the leisurely activity of horse riding, visiting Banner Equestrian Centre is a good idea. </p>
