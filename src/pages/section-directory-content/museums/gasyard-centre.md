<p>Regeneration project directed by a community in the heart of the Brandywell and Bogside neighborhoods, led to the rebirth of the Gasyard Center. Located in County Derry, the Gasyard Centre was earlier an important source for fuel that fulfilled the coke requirements of the people of Derry. However, the Gasyard Center was closed down in 1960s.</p>  
    <p>The Gasyard Center with its revival now hosts a multipurpose auditorium with excellent sound system. The center also offers non residential conference facilities, an art space and a healthy lifestyle eatery at competitive prices. It has been host to renowned theater companies along with numerous international artists such as Undertones, Sharoon Shannon and Damien Dempsey. This marvelous place deserves a visit by everyone, including adults and children.</p>
