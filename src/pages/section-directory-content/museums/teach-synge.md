<p>Located in island of Inishmaan of Aran Islands in County Galway is a beautiful cottage known as Teach Synge, which is 300 years old. Teach Synge Cottage is now a museum that has been refurbished to revive its past glory. The museum is dedicated to John Millington Synge, the celebrated playwright, who visited the house for the first time in 1898, where he was greeted by Paidin MacDonnchadha and Brid. Efforts have been made to restore the cottage in the same condition it was in when J M Synge visited here. The museum includes famous works of J M Synge along with photographs, letters and drawings.
