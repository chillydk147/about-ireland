<p>The sole operational narrow gauge railway of Donegal, it resides in the heart of mountainous scenery of Ireland. Visitors enjoy the traditional, mythical and folklore of the location. Earlier, along the clear waters of Loch Finn, around 200 miles of narrow gauge railway used to operate. This railway service was available by the County Donegal and Derry and Lough Swilly Railway Companies.</p>  
    <p>Visitors can enjoy the beauty of Ireland on this three mile trip where railway runs across the shores of Loch Finn. On 3rd June 1995, the first section of the town - Glenties railway restoration project was reopened, commemorating the centenary of the year it actually started in 1895. Presently, the journey is accelerated by an ex-mining Simplex 102T loco with three turn - of - the - century Charleroix (Belgian) passenger tramcars. For track-laying and shunting, the work-horse is an ex-Bord na Mona bogs railway Ruston loco. </p>
