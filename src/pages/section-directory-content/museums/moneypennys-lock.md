<p>Moneypennys Lock dates back to the year 1804. It is discovered when a renovation and rebuilding was carried out on the Newry Canal under the supervision of John Brownrigg. The first major inland canal in the British Isles was The Newry Canal. Moneypennys Lock has a two-storey building along with a single-bay gabled section that faces the canal. It is also popular for being a bothy containing a warehouse, stabling for eight canal horses and lodging for the lighter men. Due to its historic significance and centralized location, the tourist destination is popular among visitors.</p>
