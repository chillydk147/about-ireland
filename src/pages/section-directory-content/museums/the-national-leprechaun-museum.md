Dedicated to leprechauns, the museum has been designed by Tom O'Rahilly and claims to be the first ever leprechaun museum of the world. The National Leprechaun Museum is divided into several rooms, explaining the leprechaun folklore. </p>

In addition, there is one room that is sheltered by umbrellas from falling rain while the other room displays a rainbow, followed by another room with a tree stump and crock of shining gold.
