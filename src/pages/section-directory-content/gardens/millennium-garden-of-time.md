<p>The Millennium Garden of Time gets its name and theme from ChiRho page from the Book of Kells, which is a Greek abbreviated monogram for Christ's name. While touring the garden, one will find many ponds, each of which has a fountain clock that depicts a different aspect of time. For instance, there is a pond with a clock in which two snakes are entwined around each other, representing a strong motif in the Book of Kells. They spout water on the numerals designed on the circumference as they rotate specifically to show the time. Similarly there are many other interesting clocks in the garden. Once there, one should not miss out watching the four illuminated evangelists on a large ceramic tablet. The beauty of the garden reflects the lavish amount spent on it. </p>
