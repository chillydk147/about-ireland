Presently, the house holds the display of collection of portraits, furniture and decorative arts belonging to that family. </p> 
    <p>The house is popular for its notable Costume collection that encompasses some the exclusive pieces from 18th to 20th century. Another major attraction of the garden is the 'Living-History' tour that gives the brief of ten generations of family. The place is also a home to the Ireland's best-documented ghosts.
