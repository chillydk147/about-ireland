<p>The Gearagh in County Cork of Ireland is most often identified as the only widespread remains of Alluvial Forest in Western Europe. Of the many things said about the region is the legend that a thousand people can visit the place and never run into each other. Nevertheless, one should try and visit this place as it makes for an easy walk. One is not likely to tire oneself out on a walk around this woodland as the terrain is not tough to win over. Designated as a Natural Reserve, this area which is drained by River Lee can get visitors some excellent snapshots too. </p>
