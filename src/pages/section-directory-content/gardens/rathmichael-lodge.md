<p>The old world charm of Rathmichael Lodge is so deeply impressive that it will transport one to a different time period. The romantic aura of the place is further strengthened by the presence of old roses twisting around apple trees, honeysuckle and clematis. It is due to this reason that one is overwhelmed by different fragrances, color and bounty of nature while taking a tour of the garden. One can also spot several herbaceous flowers around the roses and pleasant colors on the borders. Tended by Richard and Corinne Hewat, Rathmichael Lodge also has a cutting and vegetable garden as well as a grass tennis court. A Millennium walk of Turkish Hazel has also been planted recently to drag the tourists to visit the place.</p>
