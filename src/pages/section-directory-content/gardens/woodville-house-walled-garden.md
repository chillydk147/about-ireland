<p>Woodville House Walled Garden, located near the Slieve Aughty Mountains in South East Galway, is one of the few places where 'garden follies' can still be found. Ever since the restoration of the garden, one can also find colorful herbaceous borders, calm water fountain and long-standing fruit trees within its vicinity. Those interested in the history of Woodville should visit the stable adjacent to it. There, one can learn about the two Galway families that were once the proud owners of the Woodville House. This beautiful place has interesting things in store for both gardening as well as history lovers. </p>
