<p>Guy L. Wilson Daffodil Garden in County Derry is named after the famous daffodil breeder who did much to promote this plant, whose origin lies outside Ireland. Yet it is Ireland which seems to have become synonymous with Daffodil breeding than any other nation. This public garden, with its 400 Irish-bred varieties of daffodils and narcissus, is a visible proof of this claim which may otherwise be discarded off as an exaggeration. </p>  
    <p>If one really wants to see crop of this flower in its full bloom, then one should visit this place in the middle of April. While there, one will also get to discover how much life it breathes into the beauty of the University of Ulster on whose grounds it is located. </p>
