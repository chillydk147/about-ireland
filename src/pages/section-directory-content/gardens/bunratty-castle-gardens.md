<p>Bunratty Castle Gardens is one of the popular places from where one can explore the rolling landscape of West Clare. The place also allows one to delve into the mysteries of South and Southwest Ireland by providing accommodation facilities. It offers fifty seven holiday home cottages to provide accommodation to tourists and visitors. However, the highlight of the place is of course the formal walled gardens which are modeled on those of Regency period. The gardens also supply fruit, vegetables and flowers to Bunratty House. The house, which is also part of the property, was originally built in 1804 and lives up to the elegance expected of quintessential Victorian style. If one wants to discover what Ireland has in store in terms of natural beauty and architecture, one must visit the Bunratty Castle Gardens. </p>
