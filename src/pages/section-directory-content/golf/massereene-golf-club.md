The mound at the twelfth hole is part of the legacy of the time when  some troops wished to make O'Neill relinquish his power in Tyrone. They marched  along this road and crossed the Lough with the help of boats and also used a  flagpole planted on the mound as a beacon while rowing back to Antrim   According to a legend, the mound was actually used as burial place for those  who died in the 1798 Battle of Antrim and is thus called 'Rebels Grave'. </p>
