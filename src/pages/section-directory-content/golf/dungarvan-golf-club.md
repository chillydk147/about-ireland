<p>The championship parkland course at Dungarvan Golf Club, County Waterford, has many  interesting and pleasant sights for those who want to admire its natural beauty  alongside the game. The opportunity to witness the wonders of nature arise  because of the fact that the club has Comeragh Mountains as its backdrop. The  architectural soundness of this 18 hole course excites all golfers and compels  them to prove their mettle. The area on which men are allowed to play measures  6,688 yards, while the women can play on an area of 5,456 yards. The club also  has a special policy towards visitors with the view to provide them an  excellent time at the course. </p>
