<p>Spread over an area of 200 acres and having a par score of 71, Castleisland Golf Club  in County Kerry is one of the newly developed golf courses in Ireland. Golf  lovers can visit the club at any time of the year to play their favorite sport  at this 18 hole parkland style golf course.  <br />
  Designed  by Dr. Arthur Spring, the course has been constructed to live up to highest  championship standards. The undulating terrain of mature wood that existed  prior to the construction of the course has now been crafted to architectural  perfection. The efforts of the architect resulted in the creation of this  world-class golf course in 2002 which is a treat to watch. Another reason  because of which this golf course is popular among locals as well as tourists  is the presence of modern sand-based greens and tees. <br />
  Castleisland  Golf Club allows visitors to come in for a game on all days and have fun with  their friends and family. However, it is imperative that visitors should book  their tee time in advance; especially on weekends and holidays to avoid any  last-minute confusions. One can also enjoy facilities like clubhouse and bar  provided by the club apart from the scenic beauty of the surroundings. People  can visit this club with their loved ones to have fun and enjoy a good game of  golf.     <br />
