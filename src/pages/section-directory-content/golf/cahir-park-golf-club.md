<p>Making its  presence felt in the world of golf since 1969, Cahir Golf Club course is  designed in parkland style. The terrain on which it is built was once a part of  Lord Cahir's estate. It has 18 holes in total with streams and lakes that pose  a tough challenge to even expert golfers. Those who have supposedly mastered  the game of golf may be in for a shock as their skills are put to test by the  water hazards on this course. Water features can be found around seven holes on  the course with River Suir coming into play at two holes. This enables one to  enjoy the magnificent views of the beauty of its natural environs, while  enjoying a taxing game. Apart from the water hazards, the mature trees on the  course are also difficult to play over that should not be taken non-seriously  even if one happens to be a long hitter. </p>
<p>Out of the  18 holes on the course, the 7th hole is hailed as the most excellent  one. In addition to this, the world-class facilities such as trolleys and clubs  for rent, bar and practice area offered by Cahir Park Golf Club are also one of  the primary attractions of this place.Â  </p>
