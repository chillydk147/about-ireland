<p>Recently ranked  among the top 50 best links complex in the world, Ballyliffin Golf club has two  courses to boast of, the Old Links and Glashedy Links. The club is declared to  be an undisputed leader in the league of 36 holes golf clubs by experts and  lovers of golf. Located in the northern part of Ireland, both the spectacular  courses are equally great to play at. Rather, it is said that a golfer must  play at both if he wishes to pick a favourite and even then the choice is  subjective. The golf holes at these courses are hailed as well-crafted if  nothing better. Furthermore, the conditioning and quality of these courses have  captured the attention of many avid golfers.Â  </p>
<p>The club was first  set up in 1947 and its two courses have undergone a few renovations in the  hands of several architects. The rumpled fairways, which quickly vary from tee  to green, of the Old links have proven to be one of the major pulls for those  keen on playing the game. At present, the course is being given a makeover with  the intention to make golfing easy for regular players. Although the journey to  this world-class golf club is arduous, it is worth making the effort for a passionate golfer if he wants a memorable sporting experience.</p>
