<p>The  scenic beauty of Portarlington Golf Club is the first thing that strikes  everyone who visits this place. Located in County Laois, the golf course at the  club is considered impressive for its mature parkland style of design. The club  offers facilities like golf shop, an impressive club house and a restaurant  where visitors are given warm welcome and impeccable services. The restaurant  is known for its fabulous service which even keeps into consideration the  different tastes of visitors. </p>
<p>This  18 holes course presents many tough and exciting holes to passionate golfers  who can test their skills. The club started off as a nine holes course in 1908  and was upgraded to 18 holes only in 1987. At present, its course spreads over  an area of almost six thousand meters in length, which preserves as well as  promotes wildlife of the area. The architect, Eddie Hackett, has tapped in the  full potential of the available terrain to provide a course which is wondrously  great to play at. However, River Barrow poses a huge challenge even for  experienced golfers and makes playing closing holes difficult. Yet the  exhilaration felt after getting over this tough water hazard makes it a  memorable experience. </p>
<p>The  friendly and cheerful atmosphere at the club will definitely pull a chord of  one’s heart and uplift one’s mood after a challenging round of golf.</p>
