<p>Designed in  such a way that players of any skill level can have a good time playing golf at  this place, the wonderful parkland course of Omagh Golf Club, County Tyrone is  quite popular. The 18 holes of the course are divided in such a way that there is a twin set of nine holes each with Dublin road falling in between them. The  picturesque sights of River Drumragh are visible from the lower nine holes  which explains why some people prefer to visit this place instead of other golf  courses.</p>
<p>If  passionate golf lovers wish to test their golfing skills, they must play the 8th  and the 11th holes of this course. However, it is the 17th  hole which is the cause of the downfall of many experts in the field of golf.  The hole is well guarded by a huge tree which becomes a severe impediment for  the golfers. Another reason due to which players dread playing golf at Omagh  Golf Club are the tricky bunkers. Nevertheless, these also add a dash of  excitement and give one the adrenaline rush while playing a challenging game.  There are other facilities like changing rooms and a bar in this club to make  sure that golfers have a pleasant time both on the course and also while  relaxing after a tiring day.Â  </p>
