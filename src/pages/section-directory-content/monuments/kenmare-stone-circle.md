<p>Situated at the intersection of the Beara Peninsula and Iveragh  Peninsula, Kenmare is an impressively posh town. This Irish town provides  visitors great facilities for accommodation and fine dining. Its location near  the Kenmare Bay (where the Roughty River merges with the sea) and Mountains  like Mangerton and Caha also offer opportunities for wonderful views while hill  walking. However, the primary attraction that has put Kenmare on the tourist  map is the Kenmare Stone Circle, which is located within the proximity of  Cromwell Bridge.</p>
<p>Kenmare Stone Circle was originally built for religious purposes  and is actually the largest in the south-west region of Ireland. Commonly  referred to as the ‘Shruberries’, this stone circle is an example of the Bronze  Age architecture and comprises 15 heavy boulders. 13 of these stand vertical to  the ground whereas the remaining two lie flat at the north elevation. This ring  is different from others in Munster because of its egg-like shape and bigger  diameter. Its design is assumed to be a late geometrical development in terms  of architectural trends prevalent during 2200-500 B.C. Central to the stone  circle at this Irish monastic site is a huge capstone which is extremely heavy.  The weight of this capstone is roughly calculated to be around seven tonnes.  This has led concerned parties to think that a lot of human effort must have  been required to bring it to its present location.</p>
<p>Despite its historic significance and central location, Kenmare  Stone Circle can sometimes be difficult to find as its presence gets  overshadowed by those of commercial buildings. Nevertheless, one must visit  this Irish historical site to get some great pictures and memories that will  last a lifetime.</p>
