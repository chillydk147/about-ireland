<p>Among  all the Irish dolmens, the Lobby Rock is definitely one of the biggest portal  dolmens in Ireland if not the funniest looking. Its capstone is made of  limestone and weighs 65 tonnes approximately. Located at the end of a narrow  valley, the huge dolmen is supported by four stones standing vertically,  forming a chamber that has withstood the onslaught of time. The massive  limestone block is 4.4 meter, 3.4 meter and 2.0 meter in terms of length, width  and thickness respectively. Situated in the townland of Carrickglass, it is a  historical site that one can fall in love with for its natural beauty.</p>
<p>There  is perhaps a connection between the folklore relating to the place and the fact  that its name is derived from an Irish word ‘leaba’ which means bed. According  to the Irish mythology, the rock provided shelter to Diarmuid and Grainne at  night while they were running away from the latter’s aged fiancee Fionn Mac  Cumhaill. Nuada of the Silver Arm, King of the Tuatha De Danann is also buried  here if one is to take Irish legends seriously. The man’s claim to fame is that  he was a warrior who was killed by Balor of the Evil Eye, King of the  Formorians during the battle of Moytirra.</p>
<p>This  megalith has captured the attention of not just history enthusiasts but even of  those who keenly study natural sciences. Tracing its genesis to as far as  3000-2500 BC, this rock is hailed as one of the most popular megaliths among  tourists who visit Ireland for its architectural wealth.     </p>
