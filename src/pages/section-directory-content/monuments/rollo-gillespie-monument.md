<p>Northern  Ireland impresses everyone with its fantastic melange of attractions and  activities. Named after its county town Downpatrick, County Down adjoins the  south-east shore of Lough Neagh. The place is famous as the birth place of  brave hero, Robert Rollo Gillespie who was born on 21st January  1766.</p>
<p>Rollo  Gillespie Monument is a memorial built to honor the bravery of Major General  Sir Robert Rollo Gillespie. Situated in the Town Square of Comber, the monument  was constructed under the supervision of the first County Surveyor of Down,  John Fraser. The monument was unveiled on St. John’s Day on 24th  June 1845 and this event was believed to be the biggest Masonic gathering in  Irish history. Around 25,000 to 30,000 people assembled to witness this  ceremony in the town.</p>
<p>Rollo  Gillespie Monument has a statue of the General Robert Rollo Gillespie on the  top of a tall square pillar and the column is 55 feet high. There is a broad  base below the pillar which has inscribed tablets and this whole monument is  placed on a stepped platform. The tablets at the base of the pillar have many  Masonic symbols inscribed on it. In addition, last words of Robert Rollo  Gillespie are also engraved on the tablet, “One shot more for the honor of  Down”. These words were said by him while leading a column to attack a Nepalese  hill fort at Kalunga. </p>
<p>Commemorating  the bravery of General Major Sir Robert Rollo Gillespie, this monument is one  of the famous landmarks of the county and is worth visiting. </p>
