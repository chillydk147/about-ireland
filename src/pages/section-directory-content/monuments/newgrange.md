<p>Located  in the Country Meath  Newgrange is a prehistoric monument which is an integral  part of Brú na Bóinne, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. No guided tour to places  of historical importance in Ireland is complete without a visit to Newgrange.  Constructed between the period falling between circa 3100 and 2900 BCE, the  place has attracted attention of archeologists and general public alike because  of its serene environment. </p>
<p>This  burial place is accompanied by two other tomb mounds known as Knowth and Dowth,  located within the Brú na Bóinne complex. Similarities between Newgrange and  other buildings in or around West Europe belonging to Neolithic times, like  Bryn Celiin Ddu in Wales and Maeshowe in Sctoland cannot be ruled out. Moreover,  as it falls in line with the rising sun on the winter solstice, experts have  been trying to figure out whether or not there is some religious significance  relating afterlife to this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Newgrange  is a haven for the art lover with its abstract Neolithic rock carvings that are  a veritable aesthetic treat. These artistic carvings are either curvilinear or  rectilinear with each rock exhibiting distinctive styles and skills needed for  the art. Perhaps the most remarkable instance of the artistic excellence  displayed by the carvings at the tomb is triskele-like features on the stone  placed at the entrance. This stone is hailed as one of the best surviving  examples of megalithic art. As a result, art lovers from around the world  eagerly wait for an opportunity to set their eyes on this masterpiece and come  up with their own interpretation of the decoration.  </p>
<p>Although  it remained inaccessible for many millennia, Newgrange is now open to general  public but by guided tours only. It is highly recommended that one should visit  this Irish historical site in the morning of the winter solstice, that is,  December 21. On the basis of a lottery organized at the interpretive center,  around 100 participants are chosen annually. </p>
<p>The  Newgrange Passage tomb is a masterpiece of Irish History and epitomizes the  greatness of Irish Archeology.</p>
