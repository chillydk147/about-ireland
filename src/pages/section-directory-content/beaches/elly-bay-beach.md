<p>Elly Bay, situated at a distance of 9 kilometers from Belmullet town along the coastline of County Mayo, is one of the finest beaches of Ireland. This superb beach has recently been given the blue flag award and is a designated Natural Heritage Area. The latter status has been conferred on it due to fact that the area holds importance for several branches of science and, therefore, must be conserved.</p> 
    <p>The marine life found at the place includes breeding waders and wintering wildfowl which reside at the natural habitats found in the region. It is accompanied by dune systems that stretch over the western coast of the Mullet Peninsula behind which lie large areas of machair and dune grassland. These natural geographical landforms add to the charm of the place and have made the beach one of tourists' favorites.</p>
