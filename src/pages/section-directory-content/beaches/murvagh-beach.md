<p>Stretching along the Donegal Bay for up to 2 km, Murvagh beach is one of the best places in Ireland as far as swimming is concerned. Its exceptionally comfortable and warm waters are the primary reasons due to which swimmers love to visit this Irish beach in summers. It is the time when the tide enters land and crosses 1 km of hot sand. </p>  
    <p>Although the area meant for bathing at this beach is usually shallow and, therefore, unfit for adult swimmers, they can nevertheless enjoy its waters during high tide. This, however, makes it ideal for young swimmers who can swim in safety in the waters near Murvagh beach. One can also enjoy family picnics in the wide dune area close to the beach. If one gets a chance to visit this wonderful beach during winters, one can perhaps also find locals exercising their horses along its shores. Trail bikers also like to visit the beach in order to face the challenges posed by the dunes.         </p>
