<p>Golden  Strand, Mayo is one of the five world famous Blue Flag beaches in Achill  Island. To be more specific, it is the largest among the two Blue flag beaches  in the historic village of Dugort, which is in the northern part of the Island.  The other name of the beach, Barnyagappul Strand, has evolved from the Gaelic  'Tra Bhearna na gCapall' which means the strand of the gap of the horses.</p>
<p>As it is a  blue flag beach, one can safely assume that the bathing areas of Golden Strand  are clean, accessible and minus any pollution. While on the beach, one can try  numerous water-sports like sailing and surfing which are, in fact, the  specialty of all beaches on Mayo. </p>
