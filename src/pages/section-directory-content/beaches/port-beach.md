<p>The commercially untouched beauty of Port Beach, which enjoys a blue flag status, attracts the attention of many tourists from across the world. Although difficult to access, the beach nevertheless has much to offer in terms of fun. One can enjoy a great day while bathing in the crystal clear and cool water of the Irish Sea or spend the day simply enjoying the sun. The sandy shores and teeming wildlife, including Marsh Orchid, are other major tourist attractions. The mature dune area of the beach provides ample space for kids to play, thereby making it ideal for family picnics. The picturesque view of the Mourne Mountains, visible to one only on fortunately cloudless days, is not only pleasant but rather an experience of a lifetime.</p>
