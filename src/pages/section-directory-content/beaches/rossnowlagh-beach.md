<p>Popular for the number of tourists it attracts each year, Rossnowlagh Beach is one of those Irish beaches which have recently acquired a blue flag status. However, its blue flag is applicable only during the period between June to August. The place enjoys immense popularity among surfers, swimmers and walkers and is one of the most oft-visited beaches by families living in nearby areas. </p>  
    <p>One can find a number of visitors at this sandy beach during the summer months. With the view to keep the environment clean, dustbins are placed on the beach. They are even regularly cleaned during the high tourist season for the same reason. This also explains why tourists visit this County Donegal beach. </p>
