<p>As a part of the world famous Ring of Kerry, Rossbeigh beach is an indispensable Irish tourist destination. The sprawling 7km sandy expanse of this blue flag beach is completely untouched by the adverse effects of commercialization. The place is also worthy of a trip because of an impressively strong presence of wildlife in the area. In fact, the area has been officially declared as a heritage site and a Special Area of Conservation for being a home to many species of plant and animals. On the whole, the place makes for an ideal day out with family or friends for locals as well as visitors coming to the place. </p>
