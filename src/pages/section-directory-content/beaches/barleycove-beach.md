<p>Barleycove  Beach on the South coast of Ireland is considered one of the finest beaches of  West Cork where tourists can have a lot of fun and frolic. Located nearby Mizen  Head on the Mizen Peninsula, the surroundings of Barleycove provide ample  scenic views of the beauty of nature. This not-so-overcrowded beach and its  surroundings witness the highest number of visitors during summers. Owing to  the wildlife diversity and the fauna found in its expansive dune system, the  beach has been officially declared as a Special Area of Conservation by  European Union. Furthermore, the float bridge that has been constructed to  manage visitor traffic puts less stress on the natural surroundings of the  area.                      </p>
