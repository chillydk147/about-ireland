<p>Hailed  as the largest uninterrupted sand beach in Western Europe, Inch beach in County  Kerry provides many eye-pleasing views of Dingle Peninsula and Dingle Bay. The  romantic aura of this blue flag beach created by the picturesque combination of  sun and sand is irresistible for a die-hard nature lover. Perhaps it is due to  the same reason that the place was used as a location for the motion picture  ‘The Playboy of the Western World’ in 1960s. In the next decade, Inch beach was  again seen on the silver screen in ‘Ryan’s Daughter’ and became its second  claim to fame. It, therefore, should come as no surprise that the place is one  of the most oft-visited beaches. </p>
