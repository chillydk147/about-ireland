<p>The spectacular Garryvoe beach enjoys the highly coveted blue flag status and is situated in the Eastern part of the county of Cork. Located in the village of the same name, this Irish beach has a strand which is made of mixed pebble. </p>  
    <p>The place offers quite a challenge for swimmers but can be fun for those who are fond of having the sea waters hit their feet. Standing near the shore, one can enjoy plenty of scenic views that surround the beach. The crystal clear waters and the pleasantly warm Sun found at the place makes spending a day on the beach an experience worthy of remembrance. </p>
