<p>Newtownbarry House was built in the year 1883 by Charles Lanyon and this magnificent mansion was his last creation. Some parts of the gardens are even older than the house itself. Sunken garden dates back to 18th and 19th century, comprising stone grotto arches, pond, lake and rose garden.</p>  
    <p>The garden is home to different species of exquisite plants along with landscaped parkland spread over acres, against the backdrop of the Blackstairs Mountains. In addition, there is a gallery that forms the part of Newtownbarry House. This gallery is also part of the Wexford Arts Trail where exhibitions are organized on individual and group basis.</p>
