The artists who exhibit their artistically excellent art works at the gallery include names like Noel Murphy, J B Vallely, Basil Blackshaw, Sasha Harding and Una O'Grady Vittorio Cirefice. Joe Hynes, Neill Speers, John McAtamney and Tibor Cervenak are names of some of the other artists whose works can be seen at the gallery from time to time.
