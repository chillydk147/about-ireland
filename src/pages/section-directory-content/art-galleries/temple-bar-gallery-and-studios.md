<p>Established in the year 1983, Temple Bar Gallery and Studios is one of the leading contemporary art venues of Ireland. Based in the center of Temple Bar, it was result of the rising demand for affordable studio spaces in Dublin city center. This move proved to be an important step in establishing status of Temple Bar as Dublin's cultural quarter. In the mid-nineties, custom designing was done for an entirely new studio and gallery complex by leading Irish architects McCullough and Mulvin. </p>  
    <p>The building houses one of the Ireland's leading Contemporary Visual Art galleries programmed by Director and Curator Marian Lovett and curated by Claire Power. The exhibition programme arranged by the gallery displays a range of contemporary art practices such as sound, film, photography, multimedia, performance and painting. Moreover, the gallery also showcases work by both international and Irish artists.</p>
