<p>Founded in the year 1969, Tom Caldwell Gallery is one of the oldest art galleries in Ireland. This gallery is part of an older interior/furnishing business which was established in the same location in the year 1946. Tom Caldwell Gallery works on an entirely different principle by combining original and authentic artwork with modern furniture designed by the best and established designers. By doing so, the gallery tries to create a distinguished interior design experience.</p>  
    <p>Some of the modern furniture designers whose works are showcased at the gallery are Cassina, Alivar, Italia and BandB and many more. Furthermore, the gallery regularly organizes exhibitions showcasing the artworks by renowned artists and also houses limited edition books of poetry.</p>
