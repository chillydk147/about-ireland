<p>Named after the English born painter who has been living in Enniskillen, Valerie Parker Watercolour Artist gallery is one of the important cultural centers of the town. This spectacular gallery has presumably hosted several exhibitions of Valerie's work. The artist usually paints using watercolours as she believes that they give transparency to her paintings. However, one also finds the use of pastels and acrylic in her works. Her paintings depict the local Fermanagh scenes in the best possible manner and provide the onlooker an insight into the life and landscape of the town. The artist specializes in commissions and recently held her annual exhibition in the month of October. This spectacular place is a must-visit for people who love and appreciate art.</p>
