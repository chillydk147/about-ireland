<p>Among  the numerous ancient Irish caves beneath karst-landscape of Burren, Aillwee  Cave is the most popular. Sometimes called as McGanns Cave, this cave derives  its name from the Irish Aill Bhuí which literally means yellow cliff. </p>
<p>While  exploring these caves, one will find that there are many admirable stalactites  and stalagmites inside it. In addition to these, one may also come across the  remains of bears. It is assumed that it is the last bear den in the Republic of  Ireland. It is also thought to be older than most of the other Clare caves and  originally had a large stream flowing through it. Even at present, the cave has  an underground river as well as a waterfall, although it is largely deserted by  the former and rather contains glacial infill.</p>
<p>Like  other typical Clare caves, this one too primarily consists of a stream passage  that ends in a sump. The cave system comprises passages which measure a  kilometer in length, reaching up to the heart of the mountain. However, only  300 meters of the total length of this cave is open for public exhibition. The  tours finish at what is commonly known as the highway. In order to leave the  cave, tours have to use a man-made tunnel which measures 250 meters. </p>
<p>Those  who are interested in unraveling the secrets of nature must visit the amazing  Aillwee caves. There is no specific period to see this miracle of nature as the  cave can be visited at any time of the year.</p>
